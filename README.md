## Project Information

AIT 526
Programming Assignment II
Author: Team 1 - Alice Chen, Hrishikesh Karambelkar, Prakriti Panday, Sean Park

## Description of the problem to be solved

The objective of the assignment includes building a decision list classifier in order to perform word sense disambiguate and scoring the performance of the classifier. With the training data, a library of feature vectors by collocation method is build and applied towards the test data.


## An actual example of program input and output

The project begins with parsing a training data that includes variety of sentences which utilize the target word "line" and have been tagged with the type of sense the . Two sense have been provided to disambiguate "line" - either as product line or phone line.
