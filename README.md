## Description of the problem to be solved

The objective of the assignment includes building a decision list classifier in order to perform word sense disambiguate and then scoring the performance of the classifier. The training data built a selection of feature vectors by collocation method and then the features were applied towards the test data. The features were choosen for each sense based on a probability formula that calculated the association of each feature towards each sense based on the training data. The performance of the classifier on the test data were utlized to build a scorer in order to assess the accuracy of the clasifier. 


## An actual example of program input and output

The project begins with parsing a training data that includes variety of sentences which utilize the target word "line" and have been tagged with the type of sense the . Two sense have been provided to disambiguate "line" - either as product line or phone line.
